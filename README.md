# Over_Under_Achiever_Analysis
Analysis of NBA teams which best outperformed their point differential.

This repo contains two ipython notebooks
1) bball_team_data.ipynb, this notebook uses the sports reference API to pull team level data for all NBA teams from 1980 to 2020.

2) over_under_achiever_teams.ipynb, this notebook uses the data compiled in the first notebook to create a model for predicting wins based on a team's MOV, then uses predictions to find teams that over or underachieved their predictions.
